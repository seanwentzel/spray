# spray

Spray is a Cellular Automata Puzzle game where players must deduce the hidden rules of a cellular automaton to evolve an input pattern into a target pattern.

## How to Play

1. Each level has a predefined set of rules and a target pattern.
2. Your goal is to create an initial input pattern that evolves into the target pattern after a specified number of generations.
3. Click on cells in the input row to toggle them between alive (black) and dead (white).
4. Click "Evolve" to see how your pattern evolves under the hidden rules.
5. If your evolved pattern matches the target pattern, you advance to the next level.
